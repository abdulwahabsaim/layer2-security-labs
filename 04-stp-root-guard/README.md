## 📌 Executive Summary

In a standard Spanning Tree topology, any switch that introduces a **superior BPDU (lower Bridge ID / Priority)** can dynamically force a network-wide recalculation and become the new **Root Bridge**. An attacker can exploit this by attaching a rogue switch configured with **Priority 0**, forcing all enterprise inter-VLAN and user traffic to transit through the rogue device (Man-in-the-Middle / Traffic Interception).

This lab demonstrates how to configure **STP Root Guard (`spanning-tree guard root`)** on legitimate Core/Distribution switches (**`S2`** and **`S1`**) and Access switches (**`S3`**). When the rogue **`Attacker` switch (Priority 0)** introduces superior BPDUs, Root Guard immediately transitions the receiving interface into **`ROOT_Inc` (Root-Inconsistent / Blocking)** state, neutralizing the attack while keeping `S2` as the legitimate Root Bridge.

## 📊 Bridge ID & STP Parameter Schema

| Switch | Role in Network | Bridge Priority | Base MAC Address | Effective Bridge ID | Root Guard Enabled Ports |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`S2`** | **Primary Root Bridge** | **`4096`** | `0001.42AC.06BB` | `4097.0001.42AC.06BB` | `Gig1/0/1 - 24` (All Downlinks) |
| **`S1`** | **Backup Root Bridge** | **`8192`** | `0000.0C5A.0362` | `8193.0000.0C5A.0362` | `Gig1/0/3 - 24` (Edge Ports) |
| **`S3`** | **Access Layer Switch** | `32768` (Default) | `0060.5C4C.16AC` | `32769.0060.5C4C.16AC` | `Gig1/0/3 - 24` (Edge Ports) |
| **`Attacker`** | **Rogue Switch** | **`0` (Superior)** | `0001.4278.C590` | `1.0001.4278.C590` | N/A (Attack Generator) |

## 🎯 Attack Mechanics vs. Root Guard Defense

### 1. The Vulnerability (Rogue Root Bridge Hijack)
Without Root Guard, an attacker plugs into access ports on `S2` and `S3`, advertising BPDUs with `Priority 0`. Because `Priority 0 < Priority 4096`, all switches immediately demote `S2` and elect the attacker as the Root Bridge, altering traffic forwarding paths.

### 2. The Defense Mechanism (`spanning-tree guard root`)
Root Guard is enabled on **Designated Ports** where a Root Bridge should **never** be discovered. 
* When a superior BPDU arrives on a Root Guard-enabled port, the switch **does not accept the new Root ID**.
* The port is placed into **`Root-Inconsistent (ROOT_Inc)`** state (listening/blocking), preventing data forwarding.
* **Auto-Recovery:** Once the rogue device stops transmitting superior BPDUs, the port automatically recovers back to forwarding state without manual administrator intervention.

## 🛠️ Cisco IOS Configuration Highlights

### 🔹 Switch `S2` (Primary Root Bridge — Priority 4096)
```ios
hostname S2
!
spanning-tree mode pvst
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
!
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/1 - 24
 description Downlink_Ports_RootGuard_Protected
 spanning-tree guard root
!
```

### 🔹 Switch `S1` (Backup Root Bridge — Priority 8192)
```ios
hostname S1
!
spanning-tree mode pvst
spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 8192
!
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/3 - 24
 description Access_Ports_RootGuard_Protected
 spanning-tree guard root
!
```

### 🔹 Switch `S3` (Access Switch)
```ios
hostname S3
!
spanning-tree mode pvst
!
interface range GigabitEthernet1/0/3 - 24
 description Host_Ports_RootGuard_Protected
 spanning-tree guard root

```

### 🔹 Rogue Switch `Attacker` (Simulated Attack)
```ios

## 🔍 Verification & Operational Proof

### 1. Verification of Legitimate Root on `S2`
```text
S2# show spanning-tree
VLAN0001
  Spanning tree enabled protocol ieee
  Root ID    Priority    4097
             Address     0001.42AC.06BB
             This bridge is the root
```

---

### 2. Verification of Root Path on `S1` and `S3`
```text
S1# show spanning-tree
  Root ID    Priority    4097
             Address     0001.42AC.06BB
             Cost        4
             Port        1 (GigabitEthernet1/0/1)

S3# show spanning-tree
  Root ID    Priority    4097
             Address     0001.42AC.06BB
             Cost        4
             Port        2 (GigabitEthernet1/0/2)
```
*Validation:* Despite the Attacker switch running Priority 0, both `S1` and `S3` continue pointing to `S2` (`0001.42AC.06BB`) as the true Root Bridge.
